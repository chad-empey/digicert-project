Instructions:

Using React, build a UI around a hypothetical library API. Assume this API returns a list of books in a library, and allows for CRUD operation on a single book. The application should support those endpoints.

Your application does not have to be functional, just spend around an hour or two and send it over once itâ€™s completed. We generally allow a week to complete this because we know that you have other obligations in your life.
